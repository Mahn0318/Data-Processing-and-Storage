## Future Modifications
- One consideration is to add more unit tests for students to try out. It does not have to be comprehensive of the entire assignment, but it should lead students to the correct way and also clear up some misinformation that could be interpreted from the documentation.
- One function taht could be added for a future assignment could be check_transaction. It could be used to see what key pairs have been put and make sure the user is committing the key pairs that they want. It would also help students check to make sure their implementation is correct.
- One last consideration is to clarify if we only need to supply the functions or if we need to make something interactable (like this submission).
